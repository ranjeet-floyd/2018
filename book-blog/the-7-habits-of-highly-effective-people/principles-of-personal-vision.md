# Principle of Personal Vision
    1. Our behaviour is a function of  our decisions, not our own lives.
    2. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstance, by conditions, by their envirnment.
    3. Proactive people are driven by values -  carefully thought about, selected and internalized values.
    4. I am what I am today because of the choices I  made yesterday.
    5. Proactive People focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence.
    6. Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern.
    7. Our behaviour is governed by principles.
    8. The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it.
